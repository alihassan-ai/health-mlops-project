1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report evaluates multiple machine learning approaches for predicting
health risks based on environmental factors (air quality, weather) and
wearable health data. Models were trained using both centralized and
federated learning approaches to compare accuracy and privacy preservation.


2. MODEL ARCHITECTURES EVALUATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Baseline Models (Centralized)
   • Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees
   • XGBoost: Gradient boosting with regularization

2.2 Deep Learning (Centralized)
   • PyTorch Neural Network: 128->64->32 architecture
   • Batch normalization and dropout for regularization

2.3 Federated Learning (Distributed)
   • FedAvg algorithm across 5 hospital/city nodes
   • Privacy-preserving: data never leaves local nodes
   • Only model parameters shared between nodes
